# Step name 

*We recommend the step name to be concise, yet catchy, able to show the value of implementing the app to users. For example: `Flex Layout: create layouts using the power of Flexbox`*.

## Introduction

Add here a brief description of the app's importance and impact on the theme, explaining which solution and functionality it brings to the store when implemented. 
 
From this description, add an introduction for the activity that will follow.
  
:information_source: *Remember: you don't need to go into the full details of the activity or the app, since everything will be available, respectively, in the App and Activity session. Simply ensure that users understand the app's impact on the store's theme, and based on that, the activity that will ensue.*

## App's name

*Replace the title of this section with the app's real name*.

Whenever possible, firstly add a photo of the app and its blocks as these are rendered in your theme. 

Next, add details about the app, such as the exported blocks and their functionalities. Use the official documentation as support, linking it here.

It's important to use this space to also highlight any implementation restrictions the app may have, such as block composition.

At the end, add an example of a code for the blocks being implemented in your theme. 

:information_source: *Remember: this code doesn't need to be the same as the one in the official documentation. The official documentation code needs to be simpler, to allow for the app's default implementation without the need for assistance from the course. Here, however, the code given as example can be richer, containing props and set values, since this code will be used to develop the proposed activity.*
 
## Activity

In this section, present the desired activity and go through all the steps that users must follow.

1. Remember that the course's idea is always to get users to better understand the app's implementation; 
2. Therefore, it's fundamental for the steps to be brief and direct, so as not to lead to user frustration for not being clear on where the error is;
3. Be careful however: having many short steps can also be something negative. Limit the average to 5 steps per activity; 
4. Pay attention to this course's internationalization: avoid steps where corrections are dependent on a specific language;
5. In addition, always describe the steps in a clear and detailed way. 

Lastly, add an image of the expected result of this activity so that users can visualize their end goal.
